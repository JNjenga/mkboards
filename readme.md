# Mkboards 

An attempt to implement kanban boards application for Microsoft Windows with emphasis on speed, bloat-free and ease of user.
Although this project is being done with the aim of grasping the core concepts of Windows API, I hope to use it as my goto 'todolist' app to help me better organize and manage my unending sideprojects.

## Build 

Run the `build.bat` file located in the root directory, You will need to have microsoft's `cl.exe`
